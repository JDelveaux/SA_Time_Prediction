# Prediction of time in rehab based on admissions data
Length of stay (LOS) in rehabilitation centers vary greatly from person to person, with times ranging from a few hours to a year or more. By predicting the LOS of patients, hospitals and rehabilitation centers can better allocate resources to create more efficient, lower cost care to clients. This project explores the application of various neural network architectures to classify rehabilitation length of stay into 10 categorical outputs. By experimenting with different configurations, including feedforward neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this project provides insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach in handling structured healthcare data.

Data was obtained from the SAMHSA Teds-D dataset (https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/mh-cld-mental-health-client-level-data/datafiles). The preprocessing program (preprocessing/SAMHSA_clean_transform.py) removes redundant variables, expands the detailed categories (EMPLOY -- DETNLF, PSOURCE -- DETCRIM), imputes missing data, and one-hot encodes the variables for use in the neural network. The dataset is then separated based on service (e.g. 24 hour detox, long term rehabilitation) and converted to PyTorch format for use in the neural network. There are additional options present for continuous LOS data. After cleaning and transforming the data, we ended with 1369315 usable cases featuring 56 variables.

Comprehensive evaluation metrics, including accuracy, F1 score, and loss curves, are used to compare model performance. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques are applied to optimize results. This repository serves as a resource for understanding how machine learning can support decision-making in healthcare settings by providing actionable predictions for rehabilitation planning.
