# Prediction of time in rehab based on admissions data
Length of stay (LOS) in rehabilitation centers vary greatly from person to person, with times ranging from a few hours to a year or more. By predicting the LOS of patients, hospitals and rehabilitation centers can better allocate resources to create more efficient, lower cost care to clients. This project uses data from the SAMHSA Teds-D dataset in a PyTorch NN to predict the LOS of clients, based on admission data (age, health insurance, current substance use, age of first use, and 55 other variables).

The preprocessing program (preprocessing/SAMHSA_clean_transform.py) removes redundant variables, expands the detailed categories (EMPLOY -- DETNLF, PSOURCE -- DETCRIM), imputes missing data, and one-hot encodes the variables for use in the neural network. The dataset is then separated based on service (e.g. 24 hour detox, long term rehabilitation) and converted to PyTorch format for use in the neural network. There are additional options present for continuous LOS data. After cleaning and transforming the data, we ended with 1369315 usable cases across 7 service types.

We used a five-layer neural network with 2600+ neurons, tanh activation, and ADAGrad optimization. Each service was trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 64 cases and a learning rate of 1e-3. We obtained an average accuracy of XX.X% across 10 categories of length of stay under each service type.
